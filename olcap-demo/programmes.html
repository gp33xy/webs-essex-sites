        <p>&nbsp;</p> 
        <h2 class="secondarypage">EDUCATION</h2> 
        <p>Mentorship Project</p> 
        <p>OLCAP currently runs a mentorship programme in schools in  Ikolomani Kakamega County, Western Kenya. The aim of the programme is to encourage young people in school to unleash their potential and achieve their dreams in life.The programme invites mentors to form trusted relationships with mentees in a friendly environment and mentor them in every aspect of their academic life.</p> 
        <h2 class="secondarypage">Stocking Libraries with Books</h2> 
        <p>OLCAP is working to help stock libraries with donated text books. We are especially in need of primary and secondary text books, both new and old. Other books such as story books are also needed. We work hard to see that the old text books remains in good physical order. This initiative is helping improve the education performance for students in Kenya.</p> 
        <h2 class="secondarypage">Freedom for Girls</h2> 
        <p>In partnership with Health Education Africa Resource Team (HEART), we are working on a project called &quot;freedom for girls&quot; that will see us providing girls with equal access to education through provision of undergarments, sanitary napkins and hygiene education. Thousands of girls especially in the rural areas miss up to 5 days of school a month due to lack of protection during their monthly cycle. This project is intended to reach girls in Kenya. HEART provides pads at a subsidized price of Ksh. 450. At this price, the package comes with a 12 pieces each containing 8 pads (96 pads) and 4 undergarments. This means at just Ksh 450 you have sorted a girl for a whole year. We believe we can help our girls  to get educated and pursue their dreams securing them a bright future.</p> 
        <h2 class="secondarypage">HEALTH</h2> 
        <p>OLCAP is currently improving access to health care by working in partnership with community clinics. We are currently working with Lukanji community health clinic to provide basic health care to community members, treating common diseases such as malaria. OLCAP has also been able to create awareness on HIV/AIDS through training peer educators who educate the community on HIV/AIDS. We also partner with local clinics for referrals, both young and old people for HIV testing and treatment.</p> 
        <h2 class="secondarypage">LIVELIHOODS</h2> 
        <p>People in rural Kenya are faced with lack of jobs that are necessary in providing the vital income for basic needs. OLCAP is working towards providing skills such as tailoring, masonry, carpentry, weaving, animal husbandry and farming, in order to enable poor people to earn a living and afford basic needs such as food and health services. We also help community members to access credit schemes to start small businesses.</p>
